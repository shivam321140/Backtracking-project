    <h1> Backtracking</h1>
    <p> back tracking is a form of recursion.
        


        The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these After you make your 
        choice you will get a new set of options, just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is 
        repeated over and over until you reach a final stale, if you made a good sequence of choices, your tingi stale is a goal state; if
         you didn't, it is,nt
         <br>
         <br>
        
        Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree, the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad waves, though it may be that 
        the leaves are all good of all trad, You want to get to a good leaf. At each nade, beginning with the roal, you choose one of its 
        children to move to, and you keep thai up until you get to a teaf
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Suppose you get to a bod leaf. You can becktrack to continue the search for a good leat by revoking your most recent choice, 
        and buying out the next opton in that set of ophans: If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try 
        another choice at that node if you end up at the mot wien no options left, there are no good waves to be found.
        <br> 
        <br>
        This needs an example

    <img src="22.jpg" width="150" height="130">

    <ol>
        <li direction="left"> starting at root, your option are A and B yor are choose A. </li>
        <br>
        <li> At A your option are C and D. you choose C.</li>
        <br>
      <li>  C is bad. go back to A </li>
      <br>
      <li> D is bad. go back to A. </li>
      <br>
      <li> At A, you have already tried C , and it failed. try D.</li>
      <br>
      <li>   At Root, you have already tried A. try B. </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        At B, your options are E and F. try E.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li> E is good. congratulations!</li>

    </ol>

    <p style="border:1px solid black;">this example we drew a picture of a tree. the tree. the tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could 
        make. there is also a data structure callled a tree, but usually we dont have a data structure to tell us what choices we 
    have (if we do have an actual tree data structure,Backtracking on it is called depth- first searching</p>

    <p> the Backtracking algorithm</p>

    <pre style="border:1px solid black ; color: skyblue;"> boolean solve( Node n) {
     if n is leaf node {
        if the leaf is a goal node, return true
         else return false 
     } else{
        for reach child C of n {
          if solve (C) succeed. return true 
        }
        return false 
     }
    }

    </pre>

    <p style="border:1px solid black;" >notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. this is essential to understanding the algorithm. if 
        solve(n) is true , that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is , is one of the nodes on a path from the root to  
     some goal node. we say that n is salvable . if solve (n) is false , than there is no path that includes n to any goal node. </p>

      


    </p>
  
    <h3> How does this work? </h3>

    <ul>
        <li> if any child of n solvable, than n is solvable. </li>
        <li> if no child of n solvable , than n is not solvable.</li>
        
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p>
        Hence, to decide whether any non- leaf node n is solvable( part of a path to a goal node ),all you have to do is test whether any 
        child of n is solvable. this is done recursively, on each child of n. in the above code ,this is done by the lines 
    </p>

    <pre style="border:1px solid black ; color: skyblue;">  
        for each child c of n {
         if solve(c) succeed, return true
        }
        return false
    </pre>

    <p> eventually the  recursion will " bottom " out at a leaf node. if the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable ,if the leaf node is not a goal
        node , it is not solvable. this is our base case.in the above code , this is done by the lines
    </p>

    <pre style="border:1px solid black; color:skyblue"> 
            if n is a leaf node{
             if the leaf is a goal node, return true
             else return false
          }
        </pre>
    <br>
    <p> the Backtracking algorithm is simple but important . you should understand it throughly . another way of stating it is as follows: </p>

<ul>
    <li> to search a tree:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>
        if the tree consists of a single leaf, test wheather it is a goal node.

    </li>
    <li>
        otherwise, search the subtree untill you find one containing a goal node , or untill 
        you have searched them all unsuccessfully.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3> Non- recursive Backtracking, using a stack</h3>

<p>
    Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. in fact
    that is how your recursive algorithm are translated into  machine or assembly language
</p>
<br>



<pre style="border:1px solid black; color: skyblue;"> 
     boolean solve(Node) n{
      put node n on the stack;
       while the stack is not empty{
        if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
         if it is a goal node, return true 
          else pop it off the stack        
     }
       else{
         if the node at the top the stack has untried children
             push the next untried child onto the stack
          else pop the node off the stack
       }
       return false
    }
}
</pre>

<p> Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the
     stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the 
     tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore,
      if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the
       problem.
       <br>
       <br>

    When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal 
    node.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of
     recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node 
     at the current level, or storing it in an array.
     <br>
     <br>
    
    Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successfulÂ path:</p>

<pre style="border:1px solid black; color: skyblue;"> 
     boolean solve(node n){
        if n is a leaf node{
         if the leaf i a goal node {
             print n 
              return true 
         }
         else return false
        } else {
            for each child c of n {
             if solve(c) succeed{

             }
            }
             return
        }
     }
</pre>

<h3> keeping backtracking simple </h3>
<p> All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty
     cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:
     <br>


    for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate
     solutions
     <br>
     <br>
    
    
    To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test 
    whether a node is a leaf by writing a<b> gameOver method</b> (or you could even call it <b>isLeaf).</b> This method would encapsulate all the 
    ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain
    <br>
    <br>
    Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have
     been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying<b> for each child</b>
    <b>  c of n.</b> In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through 
      them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can
       represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track
        of which ones you've already examined?
        <br>
        <br>
    
    The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the
     node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When 
     the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require 
     quite a lot of additional work.
     <br>
     <br>
    
    There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an
     ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which childÂ toÂ tryÂ next.
     <br>
     <br>
     For example, you might be able to number the <b> children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried 
     <b>child k,</b> you know that you have already tried children 1 through <b>k-1,</b> and you have not yet tried children <b>k+1</b> through <b>n.</b> Or, If you
      are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try <b>red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</b> If child yellow fails,
       you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right<b> (or perhaps north, east,
        south, west).</b>
        <br>

It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node.<b> In the chess game example,</b> you might number your
 pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in addition each piece may also have several
  moves, and these must alsoÂ beÂ ordered.

  <br>
  <br>

  <h3> Example: Tree Search</h3>

  For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the
   simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.
   <br>


A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point
 to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child. 
 All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not 
 part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The 
 first example in this paper (which we repeat here) showsÂ aÂ binaryÂ tree.
 <br>
 <br>
   
 here's a definition of the Binary tree class:

 <pre style="border:1px solid black;color:skyblue;">
     public class Binary Tree{
       BinaryTree leftchild=null;
       BinaryTree rightchild=null;
       bollean isGoalNode=false;
       String name;

       BinaryTree(string name,BinaryTreeleft,BinaryTree right,boolean isgoalNode){
        this.name =name;
        leftChild=left;
        rightChild=right;
        this.isGoalNode=isGoalNode;
       }

     }
 </pre>

 <p> Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it will define a mwthod make Tree() which constructs the above binary tree.</p>
    
    
    <pre style="border:1px solid black; color: skyblue;">
        static Binary Tree makeTree() {

            Binary Tree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;     
            c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);        
            d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false);      
            e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true);      
            f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false);     
            a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);     
            b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false);     
            root = new Binary Tree("Root", a, b, false);     
            returnÂ root;   
            }
    </pre>
    <h3> here's main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it.</h3>

    <pre style="border:1px solid black; color: skyblue;">

        static boolean solvable (Binary Tree node) {
            /1/ if (node == null) return false;      
            /2/ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;      
            /3/ if (solvable (node.leftChild)) return true;      
            /* 4 */ if (solvable (node.rightChild)) return true;      
            /* 5 */ returnÂ false;     
            }
    </pre>

    <p> Here,s what the numbered line are doing: </p>
    <ol>
        <li> 
           1. If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the children of a node, without
            first checking whether those children actually exist.</li>
            <br>

          <li>  If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li>
          <br>

            
        <li>See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null 
            and is not a goal node, says to</li>
            <br>
            
        <li> Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
        <br>
            
        <li> Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.</li>
        <br>
        </ol>
            
          <p>  This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.</p>
            
         <p> Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An
             alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternativeÂ version
       
    </p>
    <pre style="border:1px solid black; color: skyblue;">

        static boolean solvable (Binary Tree node) {

         if (node.isGoalNode) return true;

         if (node.leftChild != null && solvable (node.leftChild)) return true;
            
         if (node.rightChild != null && solvable (node.rightChild)) return true;
            
         returnÂ false;
            
        }
    </pre>

    <p> I think the version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient</p>
    <hr>

    <h3> What are the children?</h3>

One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous choices. Previous 
choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the
 right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without 
 recursion.
 <br>
 <br>

Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter
 how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the
  same color.
  <br>
  <br>

To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are 
colored.
<br>
<br>


There are two waysÂ toÂ doÂ this:
<ul>
    <li>try each of the four possible colors and recur. when you run out of countries check wheather you are at a goal Node.</li>
   <br>

   <li>
    
Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of 
countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
<br>

<li>
Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a
 checkerboard only needsÂ twoÂ colors.
    </li>
    <br>
</ul>
<p><b>boolean maplsOk()</b><br>
Used by method 1 to cheack(at a leaf node) wheatherthe entire map is colored correctly.</p>
<p><b>boolean okTocolor(int coloumn,int color)</b><br>
    Used by mathod 2 to check,at every Node, wheather there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.</p>

    <p><b> int[]nextRowAnd coloumn(int row,int coloumn)</b><br>
        used by both mathods to find the next"country"(actually,the rowand coloumn of the next square on the cheackboard)
    </p>

</p>

<p> here's the code for mathod 1:</p>

<pre style="border:1px solid black; color: skyblue;"> 
    boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) {

        if (row >= NUM_ROWS) return mapIsOK();
        
        map[row] [column] = color;
        
        for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) (
        
        int[] next nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
        
        if (explore1 (next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
        
        }
        
        returnÂ false;
        
        }

</pre>
<p> And here's code for method 2.</p>
<pre style="border:1px solid black;color: skyblue;">

    boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) {

        if (row >= NUM_ROWS) return true;
        
        if (okToColor(row, column, color)) {
        
        map[row] [column] = color;
        
        for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
        
        int[] next nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
        
        if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
        
        }
        
</pre>
<p>
    Those appear pretty similar, and you might think are aqually good however, the timing information suggests otherwise:
</p>
<table align="left" bgcolor="black" width="500" >
    <tr>
        <th bgcolor="white" width="100">   </th>
        <th bgcolor="grey"width="100"> 2 by 3 map</th>
        <th  bgcolor="grey"width="100"> 2 by 3 map</th>
        <th bgcolor="grey" width="100"> 2 by 3 map</th>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="lightgrey"align="center">
        <td bgcolor="grey"> method 1:</td>
        <td> 60ms.</td>
        <td> 940ms.</td>
        <td>60530ms. (1minute)</td>


    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="lightgrey"align="center">
   <td bgcolor="grey"> method 2.</td>
   <td> 0ms.</td>
   <td> 0ms.</td>
   <td> 0ms</td> 
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<p>




    
    The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of 
    these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will
     often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically 
     guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices),Â doÂ so!

    Debugging techniques

Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall 
back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be
 applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.

</p>

<h4> Trick:#: indent when you print methd entires and exits</h4>
<p>
    Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall 
    back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be
     applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.

</p>

<h4> trick #2: Use spacialized print method for Debugging</h4>

<p>
    Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself
     contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.
<br>
Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs 
the proportionsÂ willÂ beÂ better.

        if (node == null) return no(node);
        
        if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node);
        
        if (solvable (node.leftChild)) return yes(node);
        
        if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node);
        
        returnÂ no(node);
        
        }
</pre>

<p> And we get these result:
<pre>
|Entering solvable (Root)
||Entering solvable (A)
|||Entering solvable(C)
|||Entering solvable(null)
|||solvable(null) returns false
|||Entering solvable(null)

<h3>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h3>
 <p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug
 the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?
 <br>
 <br>

Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to
 your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example
 , you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these
  changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.
  <br></p>

The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional.Â ForÂ example,

<pre style="border:1px solid black;color: skyblue;">
    static final boolean debugging = false;

static void enter (BinaryTree node) (

if (debugging) {

System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");

indent = indent + "";

}

static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {

if (debugging) {

indent = indent.substring(3);

System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");

}

return true;

}

static boolean no(Binary Tree node) {

if (debugging) {

indent = indent.substring(3);

System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");
}
  return false;
}
</pre>

<p>In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about
     making your code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the
      controlled code will be discarded.</p>
       
      
      <h3>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</h3>
      <p>f an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message 
        printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions.
         However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following
         code</p>

         <pre style="bord(er: solid black; color: skyblue;">
            new Exception("cheackpoint charlie").printstacktrace(System.out);
         </pre>

         <p>
            will print out a message something like this , and the program will than continue normally. that is the above code just acts like a 
            print statement
         </p>

<h3> Example:cindy's puzzle</h3>
<p>
    I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You have some number n of black marbles and the same number 
    of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of 2n+1 spaces to put the marbles in. Start with 
    the black marbles all at one end (say, the left), the white marbles all at the other end, and a free spaceÂ inÂ between.

        The black marbles can only move to the right, and 
        the white marbles can only move to the left (no 
        backing up). At each move, a marble can either:
        <br>
    
<ul>
<li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>

<li>Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the </li> 
opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear.

    The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,
     which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.
     <br>


Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the 
puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to
 print out the bad news.
 <br>

The backtracking method is named solvable and retums a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,
 which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.
 <br>


Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board
 position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node.
  Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.
<br>
Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of
 approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find
  a different but equally valid approach.
  <br>

First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump, 
It cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and 
check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require 
having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking each marble with its number and searching the 
board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is veryÂ attractive.
<br>
Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a
 particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that
  must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique, There is a slight 
  complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.
<br>
<br>
<b> Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each 
    space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove (int[] board, int
     position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:
</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li> f the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>

       <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
        
      <li> If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</ll>
            
</ul>
<p>
    We write another method int makeMove<b> (int[] oldBoard, int position) </b>that will take a board and a position, make a move from
     that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board, 
     rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" 
     rather than "mutative."

    Along with<b> canMove and makeMove, </b>we are using methods<b> puzzleSolved and printBoard</b> with meanings that
     shouldÂ beÂ obvious.

<pre style="border: 1px solid black; color: skyblue;">

        if (puzzleSolved(board)) {
        
        return true;
        
        for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE; position++) {
        
        if (canMove(board, position)) {
        
        int[] newBoard makeMove(board, position);
        
        if (solvable(newBoard)) (
        
        printBoard(newBoard);

    Here is some output from the program:

<p style="border: 1px solid gray; color: black;">
    Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in the last

line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces its
 results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get
  them in theÂ correctÂ order.
